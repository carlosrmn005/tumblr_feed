# Lab 1 - *Tumblr_feed*

**Tumblr_feed** is a photo browsing app using the [The Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts).

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User can scroll through a feed of images returned from the Tumblr API (5pts)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an alert when there's a networking error (+1pt)
- [ ] While poster is being fetched, user see's a placeholder image (+1pt)
- [ ] User sees image transition for images coming from network, not when it is loaded from cache (+1pt)
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell (+1pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Is there an easier way to resize the image upon runtime, because when I first ran the program all the pictures were spuished
2. What other image site can we use for practice.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

When launching the app the pictures will look squished but once you scroll down and scroll back up the pictures look fine.
